# 04-2D-Platformer
Late work for Project 4 for MSCH-C220, originally due 10/23/21. Changed platform icons and added background music.

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.3.3

The player sprite is an adaptation of [MV Platformer Male](https://opengameart.org/content/mv-platformer-male-32x64) by MoikMellah. CC0 Licensed.

The coin sprite is provided by Kenney.nl: [https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack-2](https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack-2).

The explosion animation is also adapted from Kenney.nl: [https://kenney.nl/assets/tanks](https://kenney.nl/assets/tanks).
